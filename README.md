# Python-Banknotes
Here we will be using the UCI Machine Learning Repository Banknotes dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication) to showcase some machine learning examples in python.

The goal here is to determine which banknotes are authentic. Therefore, we will be solving a classification problem. We will try several different algorithms and compare the results.

## Examining our variables

It's hard to stray away from my statistics background, so I always like to first visually examine some of the variables that I'll be using. We make one for each one of our predictor variables.
